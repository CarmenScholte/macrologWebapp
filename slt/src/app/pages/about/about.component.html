			<h3 class="content__about__title">About Macrolog</h3>

			<p class="content__about__paragraph">Macrolog was developed by two software engineers who wanted to get in shape.
				After having used several food tracking applications we got a little tired of
				adds and payed functions that, in our opinion, should be free. So for laughs
				and learning we decided to take it upon ourselves to build a better app.
			</p>

			<p class="content__about__paragraph">Macrolog heavily focusses on counting macronutrients instead of counting
				calories. We believe that knowing what your food is made up of and eating
				the right proportions is ultimately healthier and more effective in accomplishing
				your physical goals than tracking just calories. Now, the concept of the "right"
				proportions is somewhat debatable, and what works for one person may not work for
				another. We won't pretend to know much about dieting so during the intake a few
				calculations and suggestions based on mainstream theory will be done, which you
				are entirely free to ignore.</p>
